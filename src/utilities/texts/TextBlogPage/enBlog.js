      "When I moved to Portugal in April without a computer, I used books, videos, and online documentation to strengthen my web development knowledge. With 'Fundamentals of Programming: Data Structures and Algorithms' and 'Eloquent JavaScript', I built a solid foundation. Finally, I acquired a computer and applied what I learned in my first project: a personal portfolio.",

      "In April, when I moved without a computer, I faced the challenge of continuing my web development education. I took advantage of various resources, including books, videos, and online documentation, to build a solid foundation in programming. Once I finally had a computer available, I was able to apply what I had learned in a practical project: developing my personal portfolio.",

      "When I moved to Portugal, I faced the challenge of continuing my training as a web developer. To overcome this limitation, I turned to various educational resources, including books, videos, and online documentation, to build a solid foundation in programming. First, I delved into the book 'Fundamentals of Programming: Data Structures and Algorithms,' which provided me with a deep understanding of key concepts such as algorithms, control structures, and recursion. I also learned about linear data structures and was introduced to non-linear data structures. Object-oriented programming (OOP) was another area of focus, where I deepened my understanding of topics such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Later, I read 'Eloquent JavaScript,' which expanded my knowledge into web development with JavaScript. This book covered JavaScript syntax, data types and structures, functions, and the handling of scope and closures. It also introduced me to objects and prototypes in JavaScript, asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation, event handling, and modularization and package management. I also explored concepts of functional programming applied in JavaScript. With all this theoretical training, I finally acquired a computer, which allowed me to delve deeper into React, focusing on componentization and custom Hooks, and to put into practice what I had learned. I developed my first project, a personal portfolio, which consolidated my knowledge and demonstrated my ability to apply the concepts acquired in a real-world environment. This experience highlights how comprehensive and diversified preparation can facilitate a successful transition from theory to practice in web development.",
    "conclusion":
      "The combination of theoretical studies and various resources like books, videos, and online documentation was key to building a solid foundation in web development. This thorough preparation allowed me to successfully tackle my first practical project. By applying the concepts learned in 'Fundamentals of Programming: Data Structures and Algorithms' and 'Eloquent JavaScript,' along with other educational resources, I was able to develop a personal portfolio that reflects both my training and my ability to implement what I learned. This experience underscores the importance of a well-rounded and well-founded education for making an effective transition to professional practice.",
