        introduction:
          "I moved from Argentina to Portugal seeking a better future and decided to focus on programming, a discipline that has always fascinated me. With a logical and analytical mindset, I've always been intrigued by how things work and how to optimize them. Discovering programming was a key moment, as it gave me the opportunity to unleash my curiosity. Moreover, I'm motivated by the satisfaction of making 'complex' applications work seamlessly.",
        mainContent: {
          background:
            "My journey started with the goal of mastering programming, especially React. From the beginning, my aim has been to understand how every piece of the puzzle fits together. My training has always been self-taught, and I felt the need to meet job application expectations. For this reason, I decided to delve into key areas to complement my professional profile as much as possible. The first months were spent studying on my phone using books and videos because, after moving to Portugal, I had to start from scratch. Later, I managed to get a computer and began coding more practically, supplementing my learning with YouTube tutorials and official documentation.",
          currentFocus:
            "Today, my main focus is on deepening good practices and learning technologies like TypeScript and Jest. I've started integrating TypeScript into my projects, especially in an ecommerce application, and I'm exploring unit test implementation. Testing has been challenging for me, but it's a crucial part of ensuring robust code. My goal is to learn more about writing integration tests and improving my understanding of Jest and TypeScript.",
          objective:
            "My ultimate goal is to land my first job as a frontend developer. I'm seeking a junior frontend developer position specializing in React, preferably remote. While I'm open to different companies, the flexibility of working from Portugal allows me to explore opportunities in Spain, where I'd like to continue growing professionally.",
        },
        conclusion:
          "This journey has been a test of perseverance, where I strive every day to learn something new and keep improving. Although there's still a long way to go, every step forward brings me closer to my goal. I am committed to this journey and to acquiring the necessary skills to become a competent and adaptable frontend developer.",
